# Conditional Inference Tree

Conditional inference tree (ctree) to explore the factors that impact a woman’s choice of contraception method.

The dataset used for this project was the Contraceptive Method Choice which is a subset of data from the 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Contraceptive+Method+Choice

The objective of the analysis was to explore the factors that impact a woman’s choice of contraception method. The methods include no use of contraception, long-term methods, or short-term methods. More specifically, using a conditional inference tree (ctree) method of supervised learning, the objective is to categorize the choice of contraception method using input variables of demographic and socio-economic characteristics. Understanding what factors affect a woman’s contraceptive choice would be helpful information for the National Family Planning Program as they work to achieve the goals set out by the National Health System in Indonesia.

This project involves using R to examine a dataset. My analysis involves creating ctree models. Methods of contraception form the dependent variable, and the input variables of demographic and socio-economic characteristics are the independent variables in the dataset. 

The full report can be found in the file "ctree Assignment.pdf". This report shows a complete breakdown of my analysis, including problem identification, motivation, data exploration, data preparation, data partition, predictive modeling, model results, model tuning, and proposed solutions. Tables and visualizations are also included.

The R script is included in the file "MHunfalvay_Assignment3.R". Instructions on how to use the program are included as comments in the R file. After opening the file, please read the instructions carefully before executing the code to ensure that the program functions correctly.
