# Conditional-Inference-Tree
The objective of the analysis was to explore the factors that impact a woman’s choice of contraception method. The methods include no use of contraception, long-term methods, or short-term methods. More specifically, using a conditional inference tree (ctree) method of supervised learning, the objective is to categorize the choice of contraception method using input variables of demographic and socio-economic characteristics. Understanding what factors affect a woman’s contraceptive choice would be helpful information for the National Family Planning Program as they work to achieve the goals set out by the National Health System in Indonesia.
